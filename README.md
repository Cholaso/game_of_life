## About

This is a Windows, Linux, and browser-compatible implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Rust and Macroquad.  
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton where cells live, die, or reproduce based on simple rules:

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
2. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

## Gameplay Instructions

- **Left Click:** Toggle the state of a cell (alive/dead).  
- **Spacebar:** Pause or resume the simulation.  

Start with a random or empty grid and experiment with patterns to see how they evolve over time.
